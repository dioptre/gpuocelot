Xmas 2010: Born, in 4 hours of agony

Day after new year of 2011: Reddited. Clobbered by rude people.

A month later:
  - SAH/AABB/BVH, calculated with SSE and cached
  - Data stored in textures
  - Z-order curve for primary rays
  - Compile-time recursion via templates (CUDA has no recursion)
  - 32 raytracers generated at compile-time via templates
    (specular, Phong normal interpolation, reflections, shadows,
    anti-aliasing. Run-time switching of any of these 5 booleans)
  - Win32 build added
